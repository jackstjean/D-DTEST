  For an Emblem to be an effective [[Holy Symbol]], it must be borne on fabric (such as a tabard or banner) or a [[Shield]].

  A [[Holy Symbol]] takes a specific form and is bejeweled or painted to channel divine magic. A [[Cleric]] or [[Paladin]] can use a [[Holy Symbol]] as a [[Spellcasting Focus]].
