# Description and Abilities (Entry)

  Use a musical instrument proficiency to identify a tune (DC 10) or improvise a tune (DC 20).

  If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your [[Proficiency Bonus]] to ability checks to play the instrument. Proficiency also allows you to compose original music pieces, with or without lyrics. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

  A bard can use a musical instrument as a [[spellcasting focus]]. Spellcasting this way, even without verbal components, creates sound; a musical instrument cannot be used as a [[spellcasting focus]] within a zone of [[silence]].
