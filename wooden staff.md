# Description and Abilities (Entry)
desc: |-
  This druidic focus is created using a length of wood naturally shaped as a [[quarterstaff]]. These are often made from tall saplings.
abilities: []
entry: |-
  A wooden staff functions in all ways as a [[quarterstaff]] in addition to being a druidic focus.

  A druid may create a wooden staff druidic focus by performing a special sacrament. The ritual takes one hour, burns 5 gp worth of rare herbs, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot. The Dungeon Master may instead require this effect to be prepared and cast as a [[sacrament]] spell.

  A [[Druidic Focus]] takes a specific form and is carved, tied with ribbon, or painted to channel primal magic. A [[Druid]] or [[Ranger]] can use such an object as a [[Spellcasting Focus]].
