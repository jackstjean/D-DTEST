# Description and Abilities (Entry)
desc: |-
  A poisoner's kit blends some of the components of alchemist's supplies and an herbalism kit, the tools needed to create poisons using alchemical and herbal techniques. It also includes tools for collecting poisons from live (or recently slain) monster specimens.
abilities: []
entry: |-
  **Ability:** Intelligence

  **Utilize:** Spot a poisoned object (DC 10) or determine the effect of a discovered poison (DC 20).

  **Craft:** [[Basic Poison]]

  You may use your proficiency bonus for uses of poison (poisoning food, weapons, etc.) and checks to collect or craft poisons. You need not worry about poisoning yourself merely by handling or applying poisons, but initial collection remains a dangerous process.
