  Dragon Scale Mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, Dragon Scale Mail is highly valued.
entry: |-
  You can focus your senses as a [[Magic]] action to discern the distance and direction to the closest red dragon within 30 miles of yourself. This action can't be used again until the next dawn.

  The wearer has [[Disadvantage]] on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
