# Description and Abilities (Entry)
desc: |-
  A box containing cosmetics, hair dies, and adhesive-mounted facial prosthetics used to create a variety of disguises.
abilities: []
entry: |-
  **Ability:** Charisma 

  **Utilize:** Apply makeup (DC 10), cover distinguishing marks or injuries (DC 10), spot a disguise in use by someone else (DC 15), or copy a specific humanoid's appearance (DC 20).

  **Craft:** [[Costume]]

  If proficient, your bonus applies to ability checks to disguise yourself or others.

  You can use a long rest or one day of downtime to create a [[costume|disguise]]. Each disguise weighs 1 pound and takes one minute to put on or take off. This ready-made disguise uses quite a few of your disguise kit components; you can only keep one disguise together at a time. When composing and applying a disguise not previously-created, you must use 10 minutes for one that involves moderate changes to your appearance, or 30 minutes for one that involves moreextensive changes.
