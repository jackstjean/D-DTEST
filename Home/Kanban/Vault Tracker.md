## 📋 Backlog

- [ ] beast card
- [ ] npc card
- [ ] location template
- [ ] item card - switch for value where you can see output in only silver vs in different coins. Perhaps even a switch for Grain Into Gold price vs official D&D price
- [ ] [[Simple economy system]]
- [ ] item card - use charge dynamic render?
- [ ] Implement dynamic DV tables for harvesting (pg 18-25 on Kibbles Crafting)
- [ ] mounts (do with bestiary)
- [ ] fix shield item
- [ ] make it so item BASE goes NEXT to item TYPE. Reference [[wooden staff]]. It should be Simple Melee Weapon (Quarterstaff), Spellcasting Focus.
- [ ] add "inventory slots" to vehicle item card
- [ ] make a general "list snippet" that works for general items like [[arcane focus]] and [[warship]].
- [ ] make [[area of effect]], [[weapon mastery properties]], and [[condition]] lists prettier
- [ ] do a python regex thing for skills to link to a page with all skills listed (e.g. Strength ([skills#athletics|Athletics]]))
- [ ] [[for rules, if there are different rules from another source, make it so the source of each rule is over the rule itself. Example in this note]]


## ⚒️ To-Do

- [ ] fix plural for crewmate(s) and passenger(s) -- see [[carriage]]
- [ ] [[ship of the line]] snippets or maybe hard-code it to render a list whenever there are multiple variations of any item? Although I'm not sure how to tell what is a "master" item...
- [ ] actions
- [ ] [[creature type]] folders? main notes? folder notes?
- [ ] add tags for tables


## 🚧 In Progress
