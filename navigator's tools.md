# Description and Abilities (Entry)
desc: |-
  This satchel holds sounding lines, a sand glass, an astrolabe or telescoping back staff, a ring dial, or similar instruments needed for navigation. It also contains a number of relevant sea charts.
abilities: []
entry: |-
  **Ability:** Wisdom

  **Utilize:** Plot a course (DC 10), discover your position on a nautical chart (DC 15), or determine position by stargazing (DC 15)

  Proficiency with these tools allows you to chart a ship's course and follow navigation charts. It also allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at sea. It can be used similarly in some cases of overland navigation.
