# Description and Abilities (Entry)
desc: |-
  A horn is typically a brassy pipe with a conical opening at one end and a mouthpiece at the other. Horns produce loud, far-reaching notes and so are used for signaling as well as musical purposes.
abilities: []
entry: |-
  **Ability:** Charisma

  **Utilize:** Play a known tune (DC 10), or improvise a song (DC 15)

  If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

  Proficiency with a musical instrument indicates you are familiar with the techniques used to play it. You also have knowledge of some songs commonly performed with that instrument.

  **History.** Your expertise aids you in recalling lore related to your instrument.

  **Performance.** Your ability to put on a good show is improved when you incorporate an instrument into your act.

  **Compose a Tune.** As part of a long rest, you can compose a new tune and lyrics for your instrument. You might use this ability to impress a noble or spread scandalous rumors with a catchy tune.
