# Scenes 

# Scene Outline: Investigating the Kraken Society in Sarimport

- [ ] **Prior to being found by [[Eleanora Rossolio|Eleanora]] and [[Khemed]]**
  - [ ] **Kraken Society Medallion**: Ornate brooch of a kraken—identical to the one carried by the party. Hidden inside a locked drawer beneath Matteo’s desk.
  - [ ] [[Matteo's Letter 1]], [[Matteo's Letter 2]]: Two coded letters referencing “Chambermen,” “gifts,” and a coming awakening. Signed with the sigil of Imryth.
  - [ ] **Portrait**: A formal painting of the Rossolio family. Beneath a young Elara is scrawled in Matteo’s hand: *“My Hope.”*

- [ ] **Speaking with [[Eleanora Rossolio|Eleanora]]**
  - [ ] Enters shocked and furious at the breach of security—especially by Elara.
  - [ ] Calms but remains distant; confirms Matteo was involved in “unsanctioned circles” but knows no names.
  - [ ] Provides the party with a letter to **Velmira** at **The White-Winged Griffon**, suggesting the **Hand of Sarim** may know who the symbol belongs to.

- [ ] **Searching for the Hand of Sarim**
  - [ ] Party navigates the Mossdock Ward.
  - [ ] A **town crier** in the square announces:  
    *“One night only—**The Saint of the Second Verse**, voice of the Westwind Court, performing aboard the Grand Dame!”*
  - [ ] Subtle hint: the name refers to **David Matthews**, known by Milo’s player.

- [ ] **Interactions with the Hand of Sarim**
  - [ ] Velmira receives the party in a private backroom at the Whitewhings.
  - [ ] She confirms seeing **another kraken brooch**—worn by a woman in violet silk known as **Atalia**.
  - [ ] The Hand previously attempted to recruit her and backed off after realizing she was “claimed.”
  - [ ] Velmira tells the party that **Atalia only appears aboard the Grand Dame** and that she is the most direct lead they’ll find. 
	  - [ ] She's got words like honey and an excellent Sava player, too. Knows your every move before you make it. Could have used someone like that but we can't seem to get her to turn. 
  - [ ] Offers forged credentials or a backdoor contact to get the party aboard the Grand Dame under false titles.

- [ ] Boarding the [[Grand Dame]]
	- [ ] Met by Pow Ming who offers to exchange gems or coin for golden geese, the wooden betting chips
