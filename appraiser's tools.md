# Description and Abilities (Entry)
desc: |-
  A satchel containing a multitiered scale with a set of weights, a jeweler's loupe, vials of substances for identifying minerals through alchemical reactions, and a set of thick manuals to classify materials and index market values.
abilities: []
entry: |-
  **Ability:** Intelligence *(If proficient, your bonus applies to Intelligence checks to appraise valuables.)*

  **Utilize:** Use appraiser's tools to identify the techniques used to refine an examined gemstone (convert it from its raw state) and determine the technique's origin (DC 10) or spot costume jewelry or costume adornments to clothing armor, or weapons (DC 15).

  If you have proficiency with a tool, add your [[Proficiency Bonus]] to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have proficiency in a skill that's used with that check, you have [[Advantage]] on the check too.
