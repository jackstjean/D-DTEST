# Description and Abilities (Entry)
desc: |-
  A reliquary is a tiny box holding an item of religious significance. A common example would be the finger bone of a prophet, or a fragment of a larger holy relic.
abilities: []
entry: |-
  For a Reliquary to be an effective [[Holy Symbol]], it must be held.

  Bigger, less-portable reliquaries are often found in shrines or temples. These larger versions are typically not available to adventurers. They can be used as divine focuses while a spellcaster is in physical contact with them.

  A [[Holy Symbol]] takes a specific form and is bejeweled or painted to channel divine magic. A [[Cleric]] or [[Paladin]] can use a [[Holy Symbol]] as a [[Spellcasting Focus]].
