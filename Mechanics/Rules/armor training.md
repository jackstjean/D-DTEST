  Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain category without the following drawbacks. If you wear [[armor table#^light|Light]], [[armor table#^medium|Medium]], or [[armor table#^heavy|Heavy]] armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with it, you don't gain its AC bonus.
