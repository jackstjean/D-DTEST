  Every creature, including every player character, has a tag in the rules that identifies the type of creature it is. Most player characters are of the Humanoid type. These are the game's creature types:

    [[Aberration]]
    [[Beast]]
    [[Celestial]]
    [[Construct]]
    [[Dragon]]
    [[Elemental]]
    [[Fey]]
    [[Fiend]]
    [[Giant]]
    [[Humanoid]]
    [[Monstrosity]]
    [[Ooze]]
    [[Plant]]
    [[Undead]]

  The types don't have rules themselves, but some rules in the game affect creatures of certain types in different ways.
