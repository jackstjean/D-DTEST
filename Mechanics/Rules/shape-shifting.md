  If an effect, such as [[Wild Shape]] or the [[Polymorph]] spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies what happens to you. Unless that description says otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—[[condition|conditions]], spells, curses, and the like—carry over from one form to the other. You revert to your true form if you die.
