  A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:

  ```dataview
  LIST
  FROM #conditions-and-diseases/condition
  ```

  A condition doesn't stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn't. The [[Exhaustion]] condition is an exception to that rule.
