  Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a [[monster]] poses to a group of four [[player character|player characters]]. Compare a [[monster]]'s CR to the characters' level. If the CR is higher, the [[monster]] is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the [[monster]] likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of player characters can significantly alter how threatening a [[monster]] is in actual play. The Dungeon Master's Guide provides guidance to the DM on using CR while planning potential combat [[encounter|encounters]].
