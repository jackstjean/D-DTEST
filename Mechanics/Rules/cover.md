  Cover provides a degree of protection to a target behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of which provides a different benefit to a target: 

  ||
  |-:|:-|
  | Half Cover | +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity [[saving throws]] 
  | Three-Quarters Cover | +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity [[saving throws]] |
  | Total Cover | Can't be targeted directly | 
  
  If behind more than one degree of cover, a target benefits only from the most protective degree.
