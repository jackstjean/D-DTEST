  When you would reduce a creature to 0 [[Hit Points]] with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point. The creature then has the [[Unconscious]] condition and starts a [[Short Rest]].

  The creature remains Unconscious until it regains any [[Hit Points]] or until someone uses an action to administer first aid to it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
