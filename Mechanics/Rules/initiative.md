  Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. The combat rules in chapter 1 explain how to roll Initiative.

  Sometimes a DM might have combatants use their Initiative scores instead of rolling Initiative. Your Initiative score equals 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If you have [[Advantage]] on Initiative rolls, increase your Initiative score by 5. If you have [[Disadvantage]] on those rolls, decrease that score by 5.
