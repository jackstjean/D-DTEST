  D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: [[ability check|ability checks]], [[attack roll|attack rolls]], and [[saving throw|saving throws]]. If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The DM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance.
