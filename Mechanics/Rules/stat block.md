  A stat block contains the game statistics of a [[monster]]. Each stat block includes the following information presented after the [[monster|monster's]] name.

  ***Size.*** A [[monster]] is Tiny, Small, Med ium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan.

  ***Creature Type.*** This entry notes the family of beings a [[monster]] belongs to, along with any descriptive tags.

  ***Alignment.*** An [[alignment]] is suggested for the monster, with the DM determining its actual [[alignment]].

  ***AC, Initiative, and HP.*** These entries give the [[monster|monster's]] [[Armor Class]], [[Initiative]], and [[Hit Points]], which are detailed in chapter 1. In parentheses after the [[Hit Points]], the [[monster|monster's]] Hit Point Dice are provided, along with the contribution of its Constitution, if any, to its [[Hit Points]]. Following the [[Initiative]] modifier is an [[Initiative]] score. Some creatures that are created by magic lack Hit Dice and [[Initiative]] information.

  ***Speed.*** Here the [[monster|monster's]] Speed is provided, along with any special speeds.

  ***Ability Scores.*** A table provides the [[monster|monster's]] ability scores, modifiers, and saving throw modifiers, all of which are detailed in chapter 1.

  ***Skills.*** This entry lists the [[monster|monster's]] skill proficiencies, if any.

  ***Resistances and Vulnerabilities.*** These entries list the [[monster|monster's]] Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any.

  ***Immunities.*** This section lists the [[monster|monster's]] damage and condition Immunities, if any.

  ***Gear.*** If the [[monster]] has any equipment that can be given away or retrieved, it's listed in this entry.

  ***Senses.*** This entry lists the [[monster|monster's]] special senses, such as Darkvision, and its Passive Perception.

  ***Languages.*** This entry lists any languages the [[monster]] knows.

  ***CR.*** Challenge Rating summarizes the threat a [[monster]] poses and is detailed in the Monster Manual. The Experience Points characters receive for defeating a [[monster]] and its [[Proficiency Bonus]] follow. Some creatures that are created by magic have no CR.

  ***Traits.*** The [[monster|monster's]] traits, if any, are features that are active at all times or in certain situations.

  ***Actions.*** The [[monster]] can take these actions in addition to those detailed in this glossary.

  ***Bonus Actions.*** If the [[monster]] has [[Bonus Action]] options, they are listed in this section.

  ***Reactions.*** If the [[monster]] can take special [[reaction|Reactions]], those are listed in this section.

  ***Attack Notation.*** The entry for a [[monster|monster's]] attack starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise.

  ***Saving Throw Effect Notation.*** If an effect forces a [[saving throw]], the effect's entry starts by identifying the kind of [[saving throw]] required and then provides the save's DC, a description of which creatures must make the save, and what happens on a failed or a successful save.

  ***Damage Notation.*** A stat block usually provides both a static number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (1d4 + 2) damage on a hit. The DM determines whether you use the static number or the die expression in parentheses; you don't use both.
