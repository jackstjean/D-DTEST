  A creature can grapple another creature. Characters typically grapple by using an [[Unarmed Strike]]. Many [[monster|monsters]] have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is initiated, it follows these rules.

  ***Grappled Condition.*** Successfully grappling a creature gives it the [[Grappled]] condition.

  ***One Grapple per Hand.*** A creature must have a hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part. Whatever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only one creature at a time with that part, and the grappler can't use that part to target another creature unless it ends the grapple.

  ***Ending a Grapple.*** A Grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the grapple's escape DC, ending the [[condition]] on itself on a success. The [[condition]] also ends if the grappler has the [[Incapacitated]] condition or if the distance between the Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grapple's range. In addition, the grappler can release the target at any time (no action required).
