  You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach using its [[action]], its [[Bonus Action]], its [[Reaction]], or one of its [[speed|speeds]]. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a [[Reaction]] to make one melee attack with a weapon or an [[Unarmed Strike]] against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.
