  When you take the [[attack|Attack action]] on your turn and attack with a [[light|Light weapon]], you can make one extra attack as a [[Bonus Action]] later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different [[light|Light weapon]], and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a [[Shortsword]] in one hand and a [[Dagger]] in the other using the [[attack|Attack action]] and a [[Bonus Action]], but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the [[Bonus Action]] unless that modifier is negative.
