# Description and Abilities (Entry)
desc: |-
  This kit contains chisels, brushes, polish, and other tools used to prepare or enhance gemstones, plus small-scale metalworking tools used to shape precious metals into jewelry of various kinds. A small [[jeweler's loupe]] is included for examining jewelry and gemstones.
abilities: []
entry: |-
  You can identify and appraise the value of gemstones at a glance, applying your proficiency modifier to any such checks.

  Turning a raw gem into a standard one is a crafting project that requires 1 day of work per 5 gp of value added, up to (the missing) half of the standard value of the gemstone. This is not the same as modifying a gem's appearance; that task requires a Dexterity check with jeweler's tools and turns a gemstone of one shape or cut into a gemstone of another shape or cut.

  **Ability:** Intelligence

  **Utilize:** Discern a gem's value (DC 15), modify a gem's appearance (DC 15) or determine a gem's history (DC 20).

  **Craft:** [[Arcane Focus]], [[Holy Symbol]]

  Artisan's Tools are each focused on crafting items and pursuing a trade. Each type of Artisan's Tools tools requires a separate proficiency.

  If you have proficiency with a tool, add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have proficiency in a skill that's used with that check, you have Advantage on the check too.
