  As a [[Utilize]] action, you can tie a knot with Rope if you succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The Rope can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

  You can bind an unwilling creature with the Rope only if the creature has the [[Grappled]], [[Incapacitated]], or [[Restrained]] condition. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the [[Restrained]] condition until it escapes. Escaping the Rope requires the creature to make a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as an action.
