  While lit, this lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of [[Oil]], shedding [[Bright Light]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Dim Light]] for an additional 30 feet.
  
  Windproof: The glass chimney protects the flame from normal wind and rain. The lamp's flame can't be extinguished by wind (including gusts up to a strong wind as per the gust of wind spell description) or rain. Only a gale or magical effect that explicitly destroys protected flames can put it out.
