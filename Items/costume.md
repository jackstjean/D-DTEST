  While wearing a Costume, you have [[Advantage]] on any ability check you make to impersonate the person or type of person it represents.

  ***DM's note***: *the source price assumes it is fine clothing, but 'costume' is such a generic item that the price can fluctuate drastically depending on the type.*
