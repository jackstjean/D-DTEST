# Description and Abilities (Entry)

entry: |-
  As a [[Utilize]] action, you can use Manacles to bind an unwilling Small or Medium creaturer within 5 feet of yourself that has the [[Grappled]], [[Incapacitated]], or [[Restrained]] condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Slight of Hand) check. While bound, a creature is [[Restrained]] if the Manacles are attached to a chain or hook that is fixed in place. Escaping the Manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check as an action. Bursting them requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check as an action.

  Each set of Manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use [[Thieves' Tools]] to pick the Manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
