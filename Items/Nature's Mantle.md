  This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a [[Spellcasting Focus]] for your Druid and Ranger spells.

  While you are in an area that is [[Lightly Obscured]], you can [[Hide]] as a [[Bonus Action]] even if you are being directly observed.
