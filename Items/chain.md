  As a [[Utilize]] action, you can wrap a Chain around an unwilling creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the [[Grappled]], [[Incapacitated]], or [[Restrained]] condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the [[Restrained]] condition until it escapes. Escaping the Chain requires the creature to make a successful DC 18 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check as an action. Bursting the Chain requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action.
